OpenSource3D

What are we?

A place for the creation, refinement and distribution of fine 3D representations and 
related materials of real-world objects, all released under a free license so you can 
easily use them in your own project.

Great for use in:

Simulation

* Airplane models for flight sims
* Solid models for material structure simulations
* Aerodynamics simulations

Emulation

* Arcade machine models for immersive VR

Restoration

* 3D-printable spare parts for things no longer produced

What we are not

A place for your own cool designs, characters models, works of art and inventions.

There are tons of places available for your own designs. Whether they're a fabulously
rigged elf for use in the latest indie game, or your own functional, 3D-printable 
carrying case for a clarinet, they too have their place, but it's probably not here.

Here's a bunch of cool places to visit for
